      Warning: Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          In studies with mice and rats, semaglutide (the active ingredient in
          Wegovy and Ozempic) caused thyroid tumors, including thyroid cancer.
          It is not known if Wegovy will cause thyroid tumors or a type of
          thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in people.
          Tell your provider if you get a lump or swelling in your neck,
          hoarseness, trouble swallowing, or shortness of breath. These may be
          symptoms of thyroid cancer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          Do not use Wegovy if you or any of your family have ever had a type
          of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or if you
          have an endocrine system condition called Multiple Endocrine
          Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="modal_subtitle">What is the FDA-approved use of Wegovy?</h5>
    <p class="modal_p">
      Wegovy is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist for chronic
      weight management, along with a reduced calorie diet and increased
      physical activity, for people with an initial body mass index (BMI) of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p class="modal_p">30 kg/m2 or greater (obesity) or</p></li>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one
          weight-related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, type 2
          diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="modal_p">Limitations of Use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          Wegovy should not be used in combination with other
          semaglutide-containing products or any other GLP-1 receptor agonist
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          The safety and efficacy of coadministration with other products for
          weight loss have not been established

      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          Wegovy has not been studied in patients with a history of
          pancreatitis
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="modal_subtitle">Who should not use Wegovy?</h5>
    <p class="">Do not use Wegovy if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          You or any of your family have ever had a type of thyroid cancer
          called medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or if you have an endocrine
          system condition called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2
          (MEN 2).

      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          You have a known allergic reaction to semaglutide (the active
          ingredient in Wegovy or Ozempic).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="modal_subtitle">How should Wegovy be administered?</h5>
    <p class="modal_p">
      You can take Wegovy with or without food. The pre-filled injector pen is
      self-administered as a subcutaneous injection in the stomach, thigh, or
      upper arm once a week on the same day every week. Your Ro-affiliated
      provider will guide you on a treatment regimen that may include an
      increase in dose every four weeks.
    </p>
    <p class="modal_p">
      You should not change your dosing regimen or stop taking Wegovy as
      prescribed without discussing with your provider first.
    </p>
    <h5 class="modal_subtitle">
      What should I tell my Ro-affiliated provider before using Wegovy?
    </h5>
    <p class="modal_p">
      Wegovy has certain drug interactions. It’s important to tell your
      Ro-affiliated provider all of the medications you are currently taking,
      including prescription, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and
      herbal and dietary supplements.
    </p>
    <p class="modal_p">Some medications to watch out for include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          Medications used to treat type 1 or type 2 diabetes, including
          insulin or sulfonylureas (such as Amaryl or Glucotrol XL)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          Wegovy causes a delay in gastric emptying, so it has the potential
          to impact the absorption of medications that are taken by mouth at
          the same time. Your provider can guide you on how to schedule your
          medications.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          Other GLP-1 medications, including Ozempic, Saxenda, Victoza,
          Byetta, or Bydureon

      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          If you’re using other products for weight loss, including dietary
          supplements
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="modal_p">
      It’s important to share your entire medical history with your provider.
      In particular, tell your provider if you have a past history of:

      Tell your provider if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or
      breastfeeding.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          If you are pregnant: Wegovy should not be used during pregnancy.
          Based on animal studies, there may be potential risks to an unborn
          baby from exposure to Wegovy during pregnancy. There is no benefit
          to weight loss during pregnancy and it may cause harm to the unborn
          baby.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          If you are a female or male of reproductive potential: Discontinue
          Wegovy at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy since the drug
          can stay in the bloodstream for a long time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          If you are breastfeeding: Wegovy was found in the milk of lactating
          rats. Tell your Ro-affiliated provider if you are breastfeeding
          before you start Wegovy.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="modal_p">
      Pregnancy registry: There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors
      pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to semaglutide (the active
      ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic) during pregnancy. Pregnant women
      exposed to semaglutide and healthcare providers are encouraged to
      contact Novo Nordisk at 1-800-727-6500.

      Withholding or providing inaccurate information about your health and
      medical history in order to obtain treatment may result in harm,

      What are the most serious side effects that I or a caregiver should

        <p class="modal_p">
          Thyroid C-Cell Tumors: In mice and rats, semaglutide (the active
          ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic) caused an increase in thyroid
          C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). It is
          unknown whether Wegovy causes thyroid C-cell tumors in humans. There
          were cases of MTC reported in patients who took liraglutide (the
          active ingredient in Victoza and Saxenda) after the drug was put on
          the market. Wegovy is contraindicated in patients with a family
          history of MTC or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia
          syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Tell your provider if you get a lump or
          swelling in your neck, hoarseness, trouble swallowing, or shortness
          of breath. These may be symptoms of thyroid cancer.

          Inflammation of Pancreas (Acute Pancreatitis): Monitor for signs of
          acute pancreatitis, including severe abdominal pain that does not go
          away, sometimes radiating to the back, with or without vomiting.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          Acute Gallbladder Disease: Wegovy may cause gallbladder problems,
          including gallstones. Some gallbladder problems require surgery.
          Tell your provider right away if you have pain in your upper
          stomach, yellowing of skin or eyes (jaundice), fever, or
          clay-colored stools.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="modal_p">
          Low Blood Sugar (hypoglycemia): Wegovy lowers blood glucose. It can
          cause too low blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes who also
          take another glucose control medication. Monitor your blood sugar
          and watch out for signs of too low blood sugar such as dizziness,
          blurred vision, mood changes, sweating, or fast heartbeat.

          drink plenty of water to help reduce your chance of dehydration.
